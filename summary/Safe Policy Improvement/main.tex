\section{Summary}
Safety is what you need to have at hand when you are trying to persuade stakeholders. As a matter of interest, ensuring about the model's performance is always favorable and in some cases essential. This paper tries to come up with a \textit{safe} policy which guarantees better performance than the \textit{baseline} policy. Authors explained how to go beyond regular robustness common in the literature with demonstrating proofs and proposing the algorithm. 

Regret minimization is a topic of interest in RL which is discussed fairly well in this paper. Performance-wise talking, the proposed approach is promising over other available methods.
